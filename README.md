## My First Mobile Application with React Native


The app's name "WildBerry" refers to "Wild Strawberries", and the Swedish word "SmultronstÃ¤lle".
The app is just a demo. You can save new places but when you restart the app the added places are gone - since the new places are saved in an array and not in a database.
When you add a new place you type the street and city, and then an API will return the latitude and longitude in order to display the new place with a marker on the map.
There are also some other things to fix, e.g. assigning icons to added places.
The latitude and longitude are fetched from [LocationIQ's geocoding API](https://locationiq.com/).
