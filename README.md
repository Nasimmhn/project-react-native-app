# Project 13 @ Technigo Bootcamp - Build Our First Mobile Application with React Native


This week's project was to build a mobile app using our own ideas. I chose to build a multipage. The App saves your favourits places and shows them on the map. To save a place, the input is street and city, and then the latitude and longitude is fetched from [LocationIQ's geocoding API](https://locationiq.com/).
